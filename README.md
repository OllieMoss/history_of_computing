# History of Computing
The history of computing is clean, clear way to look at the history and development of computing since it's inception to the present day, I want it to serve the purpose of educating someone who might just be curious as to how it all began but also help someone that wants to look at the history of computing in a more in depth, meaningful way. Whether it be for their own story or even perhaps something that could be referenced in a school envrionment.

### Technology & Features
I'll be using HTML and CSS to create a stylish reponsive webiste that is easy to navigate and easy to intuit at glance once someone has entered the website.
There will be 3 pages to the history of computing. 
1. The main landing (index.html) page where the bulk of the information with links to sources of information that will open on new tabs for those who want as much info as possible
2. A gallery page which will feature a timeline of photos of computers with info on when the were made, who made them, and the purpose of the machine.
3. A final sign up page where people can subscribe to a newsletter with the idea behind that of being able to keep people up to date with developments in the computing world (the sign up page will not actually subscribe people to anything how ever in the future that would be something I would like to implement so that would be possibe).

### Website Navigation and more
A nav bar will be present across all pages that will link the user to the part of the website they wish to see with a main logo that will also serve as a link to take the user back to the main landing page at any time. A gallery link will be present along with a link to take a user to the sign up page as well.
