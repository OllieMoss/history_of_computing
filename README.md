# History of Computing
The history of computing is clean, clear way to look at the history and development of computing since it's inception to the present day, I want it to serve the purpose of educating someone who might just be curious as to how it all began but also help someone that wants to look at the history of computing in a more in depth, meaningful way. Whether it be for their own story or even perhaps something that could be referenced in a school envrionment.

### Technology & Features
I'll be using mainly HTML and CSS to create a stylish reponsive webiste that is easy to navigate and easy to intuit at glance once someone has entered the website.
There will be 3 pages to the history of computing. 
1. The main landing (index.html) page where the bulk of the information with links to sources of information that will open on new tabs for those who want as much info as possible
2. A gallery page which will feature a timeline of photos of the inventions with info on when the were made, who made them, and the purpose of the machine.
3. A final sign up page where people can subscribe to a newsletter with the idea behind that of being able to keep people up to date with developments in the computing world (the sign up page will not actually subscribe people to anything how ever in the future that would be something I would like to implement so that would be possibe).
4. I used a few lines of javascript code in order to animate the burger nav when being viewed on a smart phone sized screen

### Website Navigation and more
A nav bar will be present across all pages that will link the user to the part of the website they wish to see with a main logo that will also serve as a link to take the user back to the main landing page at any time. A gallery link will be present along with a link to take a user to the sign up page as well.

### The landing Page
The landing pade is a minimalistic page where you are greeted straight away with the beginning of the timline starting with charles babbage and then moving forwards in time as you scroll down the page. next to each name in each small section of informtion there is an 'i' icon where if you want to get more information about that particular person and their work, it will open a new tab and take you to the source websit of where I got the information that I have presented on my main landing page. Also on the right hand side of the timeline it's self there are photos of each person that is being referenced in the written content on the left to add more character to the page and also just to simply put a face to the name of the person and their work.

### The Gallery Page
The gallery page is similar in layout to the main home/landing page but rather than information about the specifics person or people behind an invention it will show the inventio it's self with some more information about that particular creation and what it does.

### Subscription Page

### Bugs & Code Validation
1. A bug where the nav bar wasnt presenting correctly in a mobile phone screen size - fixed: Fixed by remaking the original nav bar into a burger button with a small animation. (note: I'm happy that I decided to create something new as I think now this is much better than the first iteration.)
2. Bug where if the written content box is vertically longer than the picture nect to it the next ".left" content box will not sit on the left side of the page - fixes: ensure that the picture being used is of a good size and to make sure the wortten content is not longer the than photo: increase margin bottom size for image div on the right side of the page and decrease margin bottom size for the written content div on the left side of the page. This allows sligtly more space for written conent (if needed) and decreases chance of div being forced to the right of the page.
3. CSS & html code is regularly checked using w3c html markup validation serice and w3c css valdation service websites.
