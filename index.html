                            <p>Babbage is considered by some to be "father of the computer". Babbage is credited with inventing the first mechanical computer, the Difference Engine. It eventually led to more complex electronic designs,
                                though all the essential ideas of modern computers are to be found in Babbage's Analytical Engine.</p>

                            <p>Ada Lovlace was an English mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. 
                                She was the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation, and to have published the first algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine. As a result, she is often regarded as the first computer programmer.</p>

                            <p>John Vincent Atanasoff was an American physicist and inventor known for inventing the first electronic digital computer.
                                Atanasoff invented the first electronic digital computer in 1937 and tested successfully in 1942 in what is now the Iowa state university.
                                In 1941 Atanasoff and one of his graduate student Clifford Berry, designed a computer that could solve 29 equations simultaneously.
                                This was the first computer capable of storing information on it's 'main memory'.

                            <p>David Packard and Bill Hewlett founded Hewlett Packard in 1939 commonly known today simply as HP, their first product was a 
                                audio oscillator sold to Walt Disney who was one of their first clients. In 1966 they moved into the computing market with they HP-2116A 
                                which was created to control their line of test & measurement equipment. By 1980 they had a range of both machines for scientific use and personal use 
                                in 2002 HP acquired compaq and merged with a few more companies</p>
