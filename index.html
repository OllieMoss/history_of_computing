                            <p>Babbage is considered to be "father of the computer". Babbage is known for inventing the first mechanical computer, called the Difference Engine. This eventually led to more complex electronic designs,
                                though the ideas of modern computers are to be found in Babbage's analytical engine. Babbage died before a lot of his ideas were successfully created the difference engine and the analytical engine for example. 
                                The difference engine was created in the 19th century based on his original plans but with different tolerances achievable at that time.</p>

                                She was the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation, and to have published the first algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine. As a result, she is often regarded as the first computer programmer.</p>

                                He also laid the groundwork for modern computing and theorized about artificial intelligence. <br> By the end of WWII was the only scientist that was working on the 
                                idea of a universal machine that harness the speed and reliability of electronics. This led the early development of hardware and the implementation of 
                                arithmetical functions by programming. Therefore, computer science was born. <br><br> It is also thought that Turing had Aspergers Sydrome/was autistic</p>

                            <p>John Vincent Atanasoff was an American physicist and inventor known for inventing the first electronic digital computer.
                                Atanasoff invented the first electronic digital computer in 1937 and tested successfully in 1942 in what is now the Iowa state university.
                                In 1941 Atanasoff and one of his graduate student Clifford Berry, designed a computer that could solve 29 equations simultaneously.
                                This was the first computer capable of storing information on it's 'main memory'.

                                which was created to control their line of test & measurement equipment. By 1980 they had a range of both machines for scientific use and personal use
