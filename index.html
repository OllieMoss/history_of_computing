                            <p>Babbage is considered to be "father of the computer". Babbage is known for inventing the first mechanical computer, called the Difference Engine. 
                                This eventually led to more complex electronic designs, though the ideas of modern computers are to be found in Babbage's analytical engine. 
                                Babbage died before a lot of his ideas were successfully created the difference engine and the analytical engine for example. The difference engine 
                                was created in the 19th century based on his original plans but with different tolerances achievable at that time.

                            <p>Ada Lovlace was an English mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. 
                                She was the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation, and to have published the first algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine. 
                                As a result, she is often regarded as the first computer programmer.

                            <p>John Vincent Atanasoff was an American physicist and inventor known for inventing the first electronic digital computer.
                                Atanasoff invented the first electronic digital computer in 1937 and tested successfully in 1942 in what is now the Iowa state university.
                                In 1941 Atanasoff and one of his graduate student Clifford Berry, designed a computer that could solve 29 equations simultaneously.
                                This was the first computer capable of storing information on it's 'main memory'.

                                which was created to control their line of test & measurement equipment. By 1980 they had a range of both machines for scientific use and personal use

                                1973 when he sent circulated a memo titles 'alto ethernet' with rough schematics about how it would work. However David Boggs 
                                identifies 11th November 1973 as the day the ethernet was born as that was the day the system actually funtioned.

                                So togther wih Brins help they created 'PageRank' which is the original algorithm of google search, they lanuched 'PageRank' on stanfords network in 1996.

                                the "father of WIFI", Hayes created the standards for WIFI before the public ever heard of the term. As time went on the standards changed to 802.11a 802.11b 
                                and so on due to network improvements.

                                (When facebook was launched). Originally Mark wrote the software for his website 'Facemash' however that did not last long 
                                as it what shut down just a few days after it went live becuase Mark hacked the Harvard system to extract the photos used on Facemash, 
                                which was used simply to rate side by side who was 'hot or not'. Mark created "TheFacebook" on the 4th of Febuary 2004 along with his classmates named after the directory 
                                that was given to students to familiarise them with the other students. From then on through some legal struggles facebook grew and grew to what know today as one of the 
                                biggest social media platforms ever to exist, now with over 1,000,000,000 (one billion) users worldwide.
